This Python script utilizes the diffusers library by Hugging Face to generate high-resolution (1000x1000) images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model. It incorporates the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler for improved sampling performance and quality. The image is rendered using matplotlib.

Key Features:

Loads the stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 model in half precision (float16) for better GPU performance.

Uses DPMSolverMultistepScheduler for faster and more accurate denoising.

Runs on CUDA-enabled GPUs.

Accepts a text prompt from user input and visualizes the generated image.
